# ToDo-List ðŸ“ƒ
A Todo List, where you can complete taska and delete them afterwards.

## About the project ðŸš€
A `Todo List` where you can organize your day everyday. If you do not know how it works, I have with the help of Javascript created a `Popup Box` that explains how it works. The tasks you have added also has a `check button` and `delete button`. If you've completed a task, press the check button. If you want to delete a task, press the delete button.



## Tools ðŸ”¨
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


## How it looks ðŸŽ¥
